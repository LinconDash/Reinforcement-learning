# Reinforcement Learning 

An area of machine learning that deals with an agent-reward system where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment to maximize a reward over time.
Unlike the traditional machine learning algorithms that are just a set of rules to be followed by a model inorder to compute with supervised or unsupervised data, reinforcement learning is the field that doesn't require some pre-structured data.

- Example : Think of how you learn to ride a bike: you fall (get negative reward), balance better next time (get positive reward), and eventually master it.

## Core Concepts
### Terms and their	Meanings :

1. Agent - The learner or decision-maker (e.g. robot, AI, game bot).
2. Environment - The world the agent interacts with.
3. State (s) - A snapshot of the environment at a given time.
4. Action (a) - A move/decision made by the agent.
5. Reward (r) - Feedback from the environment after taking an action.
6. Policy (pi) - Strategy used by the agent to decide what action to take.
7. Value (V) - Long-term return expected from a state.
8. Q-value (Q) - Expected return from a state-action pair.
